### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

Our project is based off the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The MMSE is a 30-point questionaire which is used in clinical and reseach practices the exam is used to measure cognitive impairment in patients, also in medicine to screen for dementia.
The purpose of the exam is to estimate the severity and progession of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in a pantient over time. 

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

Our project would be a full stack application for carrying out and processing and graphing the results of the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). We are planning on doing this in C#/.net and incorporating Natural Language Processing to be allow for patient of the test
to answer verbally and convert the answer to strings to corrected. 

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

The project will be used by doctors and nurses dealing with patients of cognitive impairment. It will allow for easier testing of the progression of the impairment and easy storing and accessing of the results of the tests.
As it stands the test is done with pen and paper and this can be time consuming and can be cumberome to store and keep track of the results of previous tests. Our application would allow for quicker testing and then the ability to graph the results and possibly track the
progrossion of the cognitive impairment. It will also allow for a joint user interaction between the tester and the patient if for example the patient has poor motor skill and thus cannot type but can still verbally answer, then the tester could do the typing for the patient

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useoful?

This would be useful to doctors and nurses who are dealing with patients of cognitive impairment and wish to determine the severity of the impairment. It would also be useful for tracking the progression of the impairment to see if the patients brain and motor function is 
going to deteriorate rapidly or slowly over time. This could then be further used to determine the type pf treatment the patient should undergo in order to preserve the motor and brain functon that retain at the present moment.

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

C# / .Net

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

We are hoping to use C# and .Net in order to develop the application. We then plan to use Selenium in order to run a suite of autommated regressionl UI tests in order to make sure all aspects of the UI works and fucntions as intended.
We are also looking into integrating xaramin which is an abstraction layer between the C# code and the Android/iOS platforms. This would allow us to tackle the diverse nature of the application and be used on multiple platforms depending on resources avaliable.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

Both of us got an introduction to C#, .NET and Selenium while out on our INTRA placement but now we will have ton use thse skills to develop and application from start to finish. This will be challenging as we were both used to worKIng on pre existing applications while on INTRA. 

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
